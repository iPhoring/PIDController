### Goals
The project goal is to build a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control for driving the autonomous car around a predefined track. PID is the most common control algorithm used in industry and has been universally accepted in industrial control.
PID algorithm consists of three basic coefficients; proportional, integral and derivative which are varied to get optimal response.
